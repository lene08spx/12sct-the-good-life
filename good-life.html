	<h3>What makes a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		Every person has their own understanding of what it means to lead a good life.
		For some, it might mean having everything they want and plenty of money.
		For others, it might about self-sacrifice and the service of others.
		It all comes down to how an individual makes meaning in their life.
	</p>
	<h4>Religious Understanding</h4>
	<p>
		This way of looking at a good life is based on one's religious beliefs.<br>
		For Hindus, this can mean not eating beef.<br>
		For Jewish people, this can mean adhering to the Mitsvot.<br>
		For Islamic people, this can mean fasting during Ramadan.<br>
		For Christians, this can mean going to Church every Sunday.<br>
		But regardless of what faith people identify with, it all comes down to
		a communal sense of identity and a common way of understanding others around us
		and participating or making a difference in our world.
	</p>
	<h4>Philosophical Understanding</h4>
	<p>
		Philosphers have many different understandings of what a good life is.<br>
		Albert Campus looked at the goodness of life based on how much meaning was made
		for that individual in their life; basically, its up to that person to judge
		their own life's good.
		<br>
		Joanne Ciulla sees a good life as one determined about how much you enjoy your job.
		This comes from the view that work takes up so much of one's that, that it
		must be the factor which contributes to the goodness of life.
	</p>
	<h4>Industrial Era Understanding</h4>
	<p>
		During the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain, a strong divide arose
		between the wealthy and poor creating a great class divide. This was evidenced
		by First and Second class sections on trains and boats. Although these areas
		were quartered off artificially, they represent a separation in what it meant
		to lead a good life in the Industrial Era.<br>
		For the wealthy, it was about upholding one's status and only associating with
		those of a similar class. It involved upholding peerages and remaining in the
		'good books' of the reigning monarch.<br>
		For the poorer, it was about survival. A good life meant helping the family
		by going to work, even if it was a young child working to ensure the family's
		survival. For these poor, the goodness of their life was measured by others as 
		how well they respected those in higher classes.
	</p>
	<h4>Modern Understanding</h4>
	<p>
		There are a few main influences on a modern understanding of a good life:
		Health, Wealth, and Self-Fulfilment (self-help).<br>
		Many people today see having a balanced life and getting exercise as leading a good life.
		For them, a good life is about taking care of themselves.<br>
		Other people see having plenty of money or cars as having attained a good life.
		This view is about achieving success, and the goodness of a life is judged by
		how well one has succeded, and how much a person has to show for their hard work.<br>
		For some, a good life is about exploring the world and being at peace with one's self.
		This partly why yoga and meditation are more mainstream now, and detached from spiritual
		connotations, they are seen by some as a way of achieving a good life. This also explains
		the popularity in backpacking, as some people see making connections with other people
		from around the world as necessary to leading a good life.
	</p>
	<h3>Is a Catholic understanding of a good life different to a secular one?</h3>
	<p>
		Catholics follow a selfless way of living, based the ten commandments, the beatitudes and
		the golden rule. A Catholic understanding is one of service, be it helping out or sharing
		our many talents with the world. It is also about self-restraint, responsibility and honest.
		A secular understanding is typically selfish, and looks only on making meaning only for the
		individual.	This secular meaning often comes from having wealth, or personal pleasure.
	</p>
	<h1>Linking to the...</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2><a href="./fall.html">Fall</a></h2>
	<p>
		Leading a good life is about avoiding the failures that are demonstrated in the story of Adam and Eve.
		In the story of The Fall (Genesis 3), Eve is tempted by the serpent to eat from the tree God forbid 
		them to, then shared with Adam. They failed to do the one thing God asked of them, because of a selfish
		desire to be like God. Breaking this rule, broke their service of God.
		Living a life of service for others means that when an opportunity presents itself for us
		as individuals, it can be properly examined to determine if it is something attempting to
		take advantage of humanity's selfish nature. A life of service is about thinking of the needs of others
		before our own; to wait until everyone has had their slice of cake, before we take one.
		Like a child too excited about the cake to think anyone else wants some, this is the mindset
		that led to Eve being tempted.<br>
		This story in the Garden of Eden is the start of humanities journey to find the Good Life. God
		giving humanity free will enabled us to make a good life for ourselves. The story of the serpent
		demonstrates that	God’s gift of free will (given in Genesis 1) is a double edged sword. One can do and imagine whatever they
		want, but can cause so much hurt for others if they take too much for themselves in a moment of selfishness.
		This leads to the Catholic understanding of a Good Life as being one of SELFLESS living, whereas a
		secular view, although not always, tends to focus on a SELFISH way of living.
		The Catholic philospher Thomas Aquinas described the achievement of a good life, as being about virtue
		(sharing talents and knowing what is good and evil), compassion and morality.
	</p>
	<h2><a href="./faith.html">Faith</a></h2>
	<p>
		Faith is something that has guided decisions, provided justification, and changed the course of history.
		The Ancient Greek philosophers Socrates and Aristotle both saw a good life as being able to judge and
		reflect upon oneself, which is very similar to a Catholic understanding.
		Thomas Aquinas constantly extolled the idea that the perfect life exists only in heaven. He argued
		that we could never achieve perfect happiness, but should strive for it through service, respect and by
		listening to others genuinely.<br>
		The Catholic faith, and by extension the vast majority of Christian traditions, view the sacraments as
		a way of leading a good life. This relates to the Jewish idea of ritual adherence, but can be better
		justified with the idea of service and self-restraint. Partaking in the sacraments are about having a
		relationship with God, allowing us to have more meaningful relationships with others.
		Romans 2:25-29 describes "Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law,
		you have become as though you had not been circumcised." This means that rituals have value to
		strengthening your faith and service of God, but if you do not follow law of God,
		which as explained by Jesus (Matthew 7:12) is "Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them,
		for this is the Law", then rituals mean nothing and serve no purpose because you have hurt
		your relationship with God.
		<br>
		The serpent snake represents evil but as argued by St Augustine, evil is not
		something that exists, but is	instead an absence of good. Catholics see this as
		motivation, to ensure that good works can be done to fill all emptiness, thus living out the good life. A
		secular view is typically critical of the bible for being unrealistic. But the
		important thing from the bible is the lesson and respect for others exemplified
		by the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12), "Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them,
		for this is the Law". This is based on the Ten Commandments and so applies 
		to Jews, Catholics, and  good life for a Catholics, Jews and Christians.
	</p>
	<h2><a href="./reward.html">Reward</a></h2>
	<p>
		A secular view of the reward of a good life includes recognition by others and
		feeling good about yourself. The Catholic view is similar, but instead God will
		recognise one’s works and reward that person in heaven. The secular view ends
		when a person dies. The Catholic view continues into the afterlife. The
		afterlife is preceded by judgement, which is described in Corinthians 5:10 and
		Revelations 20:11-15. Jesus teaches that entering into heaven is the strongest
		test of our relationship with God, being an event of perfect trust but it is 
		welcoming, and opens up a divine understanding of the world to us. 
		The reward for demonstrating a life of kindness, love, compassion and service is
		shown in Jesus ascension in Acts 1:6-11. Jesus ascension into heaven is a reward for
		and relief from his suffering for humanity on Earth so that we may be saved at the end of time.
