	<h3>What is the Catholic understanding of salvation?</h3>
	<p>
		Enter to heaven for the afterlife. Heaven is
		a gift from God granted through our salvation
		by Jesus' death and resurection. Jesus provides
		a view of hope: that it is a surrender of
		control but an exercise of perfect trust
		bringing a welcoming and gracious divine
		providence (Righteousness of God).
	</p>
	<h3>What is meant by judgement?</h3>
	<p>
		The judgement of the human soul of someone who
		has died, it realises either eternal salvation
		or damnation. Judgement is when a person is
		judged for the goodness of their life, and
		comprises of two main types of judgement: one
		at the end of life, and one at the end of time.
		To be in heaven is eternity in Christ's
		presence. To be in hell is an eternity without.
	</p>
	<h3>How are the teachings of Jesus linked to salvation?</h3>
	<p>
		Jesus teaches the ideas and values that a
		person should live out in order to have a good
		and fulfilling life. Jesus tried explaining to
		the Jews the real understanding of a good life,
		showing that a good life is about sacrifice,
		love, kindness, and service to others, and not
		about strict adherence to rituals.

	<p>
		A secular view of the reward of a good life includes recognition by others and
		feeling good about yourself. The Catholic view is similar, but instead God will
		recognise one’s works and reward that person in heaven. The secular view ends
		when a person dies. The Catholic view continues into the afterlife. The
		afterlife is preceded by judgement, which is described in Corinthians 5:10 and
		Revelations 20:11-15. Jesus teaches that entering into heaven is the strongest
		test of our relationship with God, being an event of perfect trust but it is 
		welcoming, and opens up a divine understanding of the world to us. 
		The reward for demonstrating a life of kindness, love, compassion and service is
		shown in Jesus ascension in Acts 1:6-11. Jesus ascension into heaven is a reward for
		and relief from his suffering for humanity on Earth so that we may be saved at the end of time.
	</p>
	<h2><a href="./fall.html">Fall</a></h2>
	<p>
		The story of St Paul descibes the reward for a Good Life. Despite his original life of sin persecuting Christians,
		we see him transform (Acts 9: 1-19) into a man for the service of God.
		For his recognition of what he has done wrong, God rewarded him with forgiveness and a second chance.
		The reward is for the Good Life of extraordinary service of Paul, in his travel
		to spread the Good News, which is evidence by the many letters from Paul to groups
		around the Mediterranean. This story demonstrates the Catholic view that in learning from our selfishness, we are rewarded by God.
		A secular view takes the view of learning lessons from your mistakes, but the only reward is that you
		don’t repeat it again.
	</p>
	<h2><a href="./faith.html">Faith</a></h2>
	<p>
		A Good Life of Faith, is one trusting in God. God is the most kind and forgiving
		force in the universe. If we can live a good life in God’s eyes, then we have
		truly lived a good life on Earth. It is about service to God and others, that
		allows one to not become overpowered by selfish desire. Overcoming this desire
		is what enables one to escape evil, the void of all good. This selfish desire is
		an animalistic tendency, and for us to truly live a good human life, one must
		overcome temptation, as in the story of the serpent (Genesis 3) and The Golden Calf (Exodus 32).
