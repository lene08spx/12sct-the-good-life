	<h3>What is the Catholic understanding of salvation?</h3>
	<p>
		Enter to heaven for the afterlife. Heaven is
		a gift from God granted through our salvation
		by Jesus' death and resurection. Jesus provides
		a view of hope: that it is a surrender of
		control but an exercise of perfect trust
		bringing a welcoming and gracious divine
		providence (Righteousness of God).
	</p>
	<h3>What is meant by judgement?</h3>
	<p>
		The judgement of the human soul of someone who
		has died, it realises either eternal salvation
		or damnation. Judgement is when a person is
		judged for the goodness of their life, and
		comprises of two main types of judgement: one
		at the end of life, and one at the end of time.
		To be in heaven is eternity in Christ's
		presence. To be in hell is an eternity without.
	</p>
	<h3>How are the teachings of Jesus linked to salvation?</h3>
	<p>
		Jesus teaches the ideas and values that a
		person should live out in order to have a good
		and fulfilling life. Jesus tried explaining to
		the Jews the real understanding of a good life,
		showing that a good life is about sacrifice,
		love, kindness, and service to others, and not
		about strict adherence to rituals.
