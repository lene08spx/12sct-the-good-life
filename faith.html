	<h3>How have early Greek philosohpers shaped a Catholic understanding of a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		Socrates: The goodness of a life is determined
		if you can save yourself and avoid complacency.
		(Need to be critical of oneself, and question
		why you do things.)
		<br>
		Aristotle: The goodness of a life is determined
		by the level of self-improvement, virtuosity,
		thoughtfulness, and self-awareness.
		<br>
		These philosohpers focused on the improvement of oneself,
		for the benefit of others. It is about having others in mind,
		and sharing your gifts. It is also about being honest with yourself,
		because being honest with yourself is the first step towards
		being honest with others and living a life of service.
	</p>
	<h3>What did early Christian writers say about a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		St Augustine said that one should adhere to practices, virtues, beliefs.
		This encourages service and faith in God, by sharing talents and partaking
		in the sacraments.
		<br>
		Thomas Aquinas: A life of preparing for heaven.
		We can only live in imperfect happiness. A
		good life is doing just things (service, 
		listening, respectfulness) which bring us
		closer to God.
	</p>
	<h3>What does celebrating the sacraments in the Catholic Church have to do with leading a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		It encourages an individual to live by principles, practice self-restraint, and lead a life of service.
		Sacraments guide us to live by Christian values through a relationship with God, and and understanding of
		serving a purpose much greater than humanity can comprehend. This greater purpose serving
		everything is shown in Exodus	3:14, with God as the "I AM". God is everything and so we do our part in
		service and partaking of the sacraments to be part of that I AM.

		Faith is something that has guided decisions, provided justification, and changed the course of history.
		The Ancient Greek philosophers Socrates and Aristotle both saw a good life as being able to judge and
		reflect upon oneself, which is very similar to a Catholic understanding.
		Thomas Aquinas constantly extolled the idea that the perfect life exists only in heaven. He argued
		that we could never achieve perfect happiness, but should strive for it through service, respect and by
		listening to others genuinely.<br>
		The Catholic faith, and by extension the vast majority of Christian traditions, view the sacraments as
		a way of leading a good life. This relates to the Jewish idea of ritual adherence, but can be better
		justified with the idea of service and self-restraint. Partaking in the sacraments are about having a
		relationship with God, allowing us to have more meaningful relationships with others.
		Romans 2:25-29 describes "Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law,
		you have become as though you had not been circumcised." This means that rituals have value to
		strengthening your faith and service of God, but if you do not follow law of God,
		which as explained by Jesus (Matthew 7:12) is "Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them,
		for this is the Law", then rituals mean nothing and serve no purpose because you have hurt
		your relationship with God.

		The serpent snake represents evil but as argued by St Augustine, evil is not
		something that exists, but is	instead an absence of good. Catholics see this as
		motivation, to ensure that good works can be done to fill all emptiness, thus living out the good life. A
		secular view is typically critical of the bible for being unrealistic. But the
		important thing from the bible is the lesson and respect for others exemplified
		by the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12), "Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them,
		for this is the Law". This is based on the Ten Commandments and so applies 
		to Jews, Catholics, and  good life for a Catholics, Jews and Christians.
	</p>
	<h2><a href="./fall.html">Fall</a></h2>
	<p>
		In the story of The Fall (Genesis 3), Eve is tempted by the serpent to eat from the tree God forbid 
		them to, then shared with Adam. They failed to do the one thing God asked of them, because of a selfish
		desire to be like God. Breaking this rule, broke their service of God.

	<h2><a href="./reward.html">Reward</a></h2>
	<p>
		A Good Life of Faith, is one trusting in God. God is the most kind and forgiving
		force in the universe. If we can live a good life in Godâ€™s eyes, then we have
		truly lived a good life on Earth. It is about service to God and others, that
		allows one to not become overpowered by selfish desire. Overcoming this desire
		is what enables one to escape evil, the void of all good. This selfish desire is
		an animalistic tendency, and for us to truly live a good human life, one must
		overcome temptation, as in the story of the serpent (Genesis 3) and The Golden Calf (Exodus 32).
