	<h3>How have early Greek philosohpers shaped a Catholic understanding of a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		Socrates: The goodness of a life is determined
		if you can save yourself and avoid complacency.
		(Need to be critical of oneself, and question
		why you do things.)
		<br>
		Aristotle: The goodness of a life is determined
		by the level of self-improvement, virtuosity,
		thoughtfulness, and self-awareness.
	</p>
	<h3>What did early Christian writers say about a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		Adhering to practices, virtues, beliefs.
		<br>
		Thomas Aquinas: A life of preparing for heaven.
		We can only live in imperfect happiness. A
		good life is doing just things (service, 
		listening, respectfulness) which bring us
		closer to God.
	</p>
	<h3>What does celebrating the sacraments in the Catholic Church have to do with leading a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		Living by principles, 'self-restraint', service.
		Sacraments guide us to live by Christian values
		through our relationship with God.
