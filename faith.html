	<h3>How have early Greek philosohpers shaped a Catholic understanding of a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		Socrates: The goodness of a life is determined
		if you can save yourself and avoid complacency.
		(Need to be critical of oneself, and question
		why you do things.)
		<br>
		Aristotle: The goodness of a life is determined
		by the level of self-improvement, virtuosity,
		thoughtfulness, and self-awareness.
	</p>
	<h3>What did early Christian writers say about a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		Adhering to practices, virtues, beliefs.
		<br>
		Thomas Aquinas: A life of preparing for heaven.
		We can only live in imperfect happiness. A
		good life is doing just things (service, 
		listening, respectfulness) which bring us
		closer to God.
	</p>
	<h3>What does celebrating the sacraments in the Catholic Church have to do with leading a good life?</h3>
	<p>
		Living by principles, 'self-restraint', service.
		Sacraments guide us to live by Christian values
		through our relationship with God.

		Faith is something that has guided decisions, provided justification, and change the course of history.
		The Ancient Greek philosophers Socrates and Aristotle both saw a good life as being able to judge and
		reflect upon oneself. These writing however were influenced by the early Christian faith.
		Thomas Aquinas constantly extolled the idea that the perfect life exists only in heaven. He argued
		that we could never achieve perfect happiness, but should strive for it through service, respect and by
		listening to others genuinely.
		The catholic faith, and by extension the vast majority of Christian traditions, view the sacraments as
		a way of leading a good life. This relates to the Jewish idea of ritual adherence, but can be better
		justified with the idea of service and self-restraint.
		Having a relationship with God allows us to have more meaningful relationships with others.
		<br>
		The understanding of original sin born from this moment. The snake as evil and
		representing Satan. The idea that evil is not something that exists, but is
		instead an absence of good. Catholics see this as motivation, to ensure that
		good works can be done to fill all emptiness, thus living out the good life. A
		secular view is typically critical of the bible for being unrealistic. But the
		important thing from the bible is the lesson and respect for others. This story
		is what gives meaning to a good life for a Catholics, Jews and Christians.

	<h2><a href="./reward.html">Reward</a></h2>
	<p>
		Faith in God to reward one. Revelations. God is the most kind and forgiving
		force in the universe. If we can live a good life in Godâ€™s eyes, then we have
		truly lived a good life on Earth. It is about service to God and others, that
		allows one to not become overpowered by selfish desire. Overcoming this desire
		is what enable one to escape evil, the void of all good. This selfish desire is
		an animalistic tendency, and for us to truly live a good human life, one must
		overcome temptation, as in the story of the serpent.
