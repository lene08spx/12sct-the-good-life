	<h3>How did original sin enter the world?</h3>
	<p>
		Adam and Eve were tempted through the serpent.
		It was a selfish desire to achieve something
		for oneself that neglected the service of God.

	<p>
		Leading a good life is about avoiding the failures that are demonstrated in the story of Adam and Eve.
		Living a life of service for others means that when an opportunity presents itself for us
		as individuals, it can be properly examined to determine if it is someone attempting to
		take advantage of humanity's selfish nature.
		<br>
		The view of a good life from a Catholic point of view is one about service to others, be it helping
		them out or showing our talents. A secular point of view tends to be more about one’s self, and
		focuses on wealth and a sense of inner peace.
		The real start of humanities journey to find the Good Life is in the Garden of Eden. God
		gives humans free will to decide their own lives. The story of the serpent demonstrates that
		God’s gift of free will is a double edged sword. One can do and imagine whatever they want, but can
		cause so much hurt for others if they take too much for themselves in a moment of selfishness. So it
		is reasonable to conclude that a Catholic view of the Good Life revolves around SELFLESS living and a
		secular view, although not always, tends to focus on a SELFISH way of living.
		<br>
		For Catholics, the achievement of a good life, as described by Thomas Aquinas, is about virtue,
		compassion and morality.

	<h2><a href="./faith.html">Faith</a></h2>
	<p>
		The understanding of original sin born from this moment. The snake as evil and
		representing Satan. The idea that evil is not something that exists, but is
		instead an absence of good. Catholics see this as motivation, to ensure that
		good works can be done to fill all emptiness, thus living out the good life. A
		secular view is typically critical of the bible for being unrealistic. But the
		important thing from the bible is the lesson and respect for others. This story
		is what gives meaning to a good life for a Catholics, Jews and Christians.
	</p>
	<h2><a href="./reward.html">Reward</a></h2>
	<p>
		Despite Adam and Eve sinning, we see they recognise their mistakes and are
		rewarded with forgiveness. The fall relates to the reward in that through
		learning from our selfishness, we are rewarded by God. A secular view takes the
		view of learning lessons from your mistakes, but the only reward is that you
		don’t repeat it again.
