	<h3>How did original sin enter the world?</h3>
	<p>
		Original sin then entered the world when Adam and Eve were punished by God for eating from the tree in the Garden of Eden.
		<br>
		Adam and Eve embodied humanity, and lived in a good and harmonious relationship
		with God, themselves and all creation. They submitted to the will of God in
		loving obedience, but remained with free will and thought. Humans were given
		free will in order that we might follow God’s plan, and hold creativity beyond
		the self. But although humanity has free will, we can act so far as too hurt
		ourselves and our relationships with God and others.
		(Genesis 3) The Garden of Eden held a tree, that God forbade Adam and Eve from touching, or eating from.
		The Serpent in the Garden tempted Eve saying it was the tree of knowledge and that eating from
		it would give her wisdom like God's. Breaking her promise with God to not eat it,
		she consumed it and broke her service with God. Adam also consumed the apple from the tree,
		and too broke his promise with God. Adam and Eve desired to be like God, but they tried in the
		wrong way. They tried to gain the power of God by themselves without God’s grace, instead of
		living a life of kindness, love and service.

	<p>
		Leading a good life is about avoiding the failures that are demonstrated in the story of Adam and Eve.
		In the story of The Fall (Genesis 3), Eve is tempted by the serpent to eat from the tree God forbid 
		them to, then shared with Adam. They failed to do the one thing God asked of them, because of a selfish
		desire to be like God. Breaking this rule, broke their service of God.
		Living a life of service for others means that when an opportunity presents itself for us
		as individuals, it can be properly examined to determine if it is something attempting to
		take advantage of humanity's selfish nature. A life of service is about thinking of the needs of others
		before our own; to wait until everyone has had their slice of cake, before we take one.
		Like a child too excited about the cake to think anyone else wants some, this is the mindset
		that led to Eve being tempted.<br>
		This story in the Garden of Eden is the start of humanities journey to find the Good Life. God
		giving humanity free will enabled us to make a good life for ourselves. The story of the serpent
		demonstrates that	God’s gift of free will (given in Genesis 1) is a double edged sword. One can do and imagine whatever they
		want, but can cause so much hurt for others if they take too much for themselves in a moment of selfishness.
		This leads to the Catholic understanding of a Good Life as being one of SELFLESS living, whereas a
		secular view, although not always, tends to focus on a SELFISH way of living.
		The Catholic philospher Thomas Aquinas described the achievement of a good life, as being about virtue
		(sharing talents and knowing what is good and evil), compassion and morality.

	<p>
		In the story of The Fall (Genesis 3), Eve is tempted by the serpent to eat from the tree God forbid 
		them to, then shared with Adam. They failed to do the one thing God asked of them, because of a selfish
		desire to be like God. Breaking this rule, broke their service of God.
		The serpent snake represents evil but as argued by St Augustine, evil is not
		something that exists, but is	instead an absence of good. Catholics see this as
		motivation, to ensure that good works can be done to fill all emptiness, thus living out the good life. A
		secular view is typically critical of the bible for being unrealistic. But the
		important thing from the bible is the lesson and respect for others exemplified
		by the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12), "Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them,
		for this is the Law". This is based on the Ten Commandments and so applies 
		to Jews, Catholics, and  good life for a Catholics, Jews and Christians.
	</p>
	<h2><a href="./reward.html">Reward</a></h2>
	<p>
		The story of St Paul descibes the reward for a Good Life. Despite his original life of sin persecuting Christians,
		we see him transform (Acts 9: 1-19) into a man for the service of God.
		For his recognition of what he has done wrong, God rewarded him with forgiveness and a second chance.
		The reward is for the Good Life of extraordinary service of Paul, in his travel
		to spread the Good News, which is evidence by the many letters from Paul to groups
		around the Mediterranean. This story demonstrates the Catholic view that in learning from our selfishness, we are rewarded by God.
		A secular view takes the view of learning lessons from your mistakes, but the only reward is that you
		don’t repeat it again.
